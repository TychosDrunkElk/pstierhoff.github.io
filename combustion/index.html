      <h3>Basic Combustion of PMMA</h3>
      <p>For the first case calculated, the ignition process was found for a stretch rate of 30 and an oxygen percentage of 0.21. The wall temperature remains slightly below the flow temperature of 1000 K (the wall temperature remains mostly constant at around 700 K) due to loses from radiation, convection, and latent heat from the released gas. When enough fuel has been released, the reaction begins, slowly and relatively close to the wall.</p>

      <h3>Near-Ignition Combustion of PMMA</h3>
      <p>If the stretch rate (a) is changed, the reaction itself occurs drastically faster. There does not appear to be a lower limit on a, probably because the flow temperature is so high. Conversely, oxygen percentage does not appear to have an upper limit and increasing oxygen percentage generally makes the ignition hotter and faster, however, at very low values, ignition cannot occur. At very high stretch rates, ignition is not possible. This point is called blowout, and is possible at any value of oxygen percentage, assuming a is high enough</p>
